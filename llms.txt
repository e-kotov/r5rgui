# r5rgui: Simple Shiny GUI for r5r

The goal of [r5rgui](https://github.com/e-kotov/r5rgui) is to allow the
user to interactively explore routes calcualted with
[r5r](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r)
(<https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/>) package in a `Shiny` app, e.g. for
troubleshooting routing problems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of r5rgui from
[GitHub](https://github.com/e-kotov/r5rgui) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("e-kotov/r5rgui")

# setup Java as you would for r5r package
# install.packages('rJavaEnv')

# check version of Java currently installed (if any) 
rJavaEnv::java_check_version_rjava()

# install Java 21
rJavaEnv::java_quick_install(version = 21)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(r5rgui)
r5r_gui_demo()
```

What the demo runs internally is this simple example code:

``` r
library(r5r)
data_path <- system.file("extdata/poa", package = "r5r")
r5r_network <- build_network(data_path = data_path, verbose = FALSE)
r5r_gui(r5r_network, center = c(-51.22, -30.05), zoom = 11)
```

Therefore you can replace `data_path` with your own data path and
explore your own routing network.
