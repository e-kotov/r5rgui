The goal of [r5rgui](https://github.com/e-kotov/r5rgui) is to allow the
user to interactively explore routes calcualted with
[`{r5r}`](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r/) package in a `Shiny` app,
e.g. for troubleshooting routing problems.

## Installation

Get it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("r5rgui")
```

Or get the latest development version from `R-Universe`:

``` r
install.packages(
  'r5rgui',
  repos = c('https://e-kotov.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

You can also install the development version of
[r5rgui](https://github.com/e-kotov/r5rgui) from
[GitHub](https://github.com/e-kotov/r5rgui) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("e-kotov/r5rgui")
```

Also setup Java as as you would for r5r package:

``` r
# install.packages('rJavaEnv') # if not installed yet

# install and use Java 21 in current session
rJavaEnv::use_java(21)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(r5rgui)
r5r_gui_demo()
```

What the demo runs internally is this simple example code:

``` r
library(r5r)
data_path <- system.file("extdata/poa", package = "r5r")
r5r_network <- build_network(data_path = data_path, verbose = FALSE)
r5r_gui(r5r_network, center = c(-51.22, -30.05), zoom = 11)
```

Therefore you can replace `data_path` with your own data path and
explore your own routing network.
