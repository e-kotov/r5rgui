## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I have addressed the comments from the CRAN team:

*   Examples for the shiny app are now wrapped in if(interactive()){}.
*   Theres are now tests for the non-exported shiny server functionality.

All local `R CMD check --as-cran` tests pass without ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

Thank you for your time and feedback.
