* Information banners about routes being calcualted and other ongoing async processes appear a bit lower now in order not to cover the new `Quit` button and other future buttons that might be added to the top row of the app.

* When no route is built and displayed on the map, `Copy R Code` button shows a warning right beside it.

# r5rgui 0.1.0
